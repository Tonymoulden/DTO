Data Types and Operations | Questions

Please answer all of the following questions thoughtfully and completely.



1a - What is the resulting type of two integers used together for an operation, like 5 + 4?
with using this you are using a print statement which would initially find the sum of these two integers


1b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?
Yes with string concatenation, being able to add phrases together with the addition


2a - What is the resulting type of an integer and a float used together for an operation, like -11.4 - 5?
It would initially end in a float


2b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?
no, no matter which one you use it will always in a float


3a - What is the resulting type of two floats used together for an operation, like 2.3 * .45?
this will also end up in a float


3b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?
no, not that I know


4 - What is string concatenation? How does it work?
this is where two strings are combined together as one with the help of an addition sign between the two strings


5 - What is string duplication? How does it work?
string duplication is the reselt of multiply a string by a number which repeats that string by the number you decide to
multiply by.

6 - Can you combine strings and integers? What about strings and floats? What happens if you do?
you get an error


7 - What does this tell you about how strings can interact with integers or floats?
you can only concatenate strings


8 - Can you use one of the operators to determine if a number is even or odd?
yes you can use modulus
